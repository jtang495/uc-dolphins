        <p class="lead">
          Pep rallies are a favorite activity each summer for all the swimmers.  Each Thursday before a home A meet the team will be making posters and decorating the pool for the meet!  Pep rallyâ€™s are for all Upper County Dolphin team members regardless of whether or not you are swimming in the meets. Come and be a part of the team spirit!!<br/>
        Another team tradition is to travel together in a "caravan of cars" to away morning meets.  We will meet at Upper County pool where we can decorate the cars and the children!

        <p class="lead">
          Start shopping, creating, plotting, and planning! Secret swimmer bins will be out first thing each morning. They are three blue crates containers with folders for swimmers labeled alphabetically. Just insert your gift into the swimmers folder, or their swim bag, or their car when they aren't nearby.
        <ul>
          <li>Suggested budget is $15-$20 for the entire two weeks
          <li>Gifts should be exchanged at least two or three times per week
          <li>Some good ideas are Gatorade, scratch off lottery tickets, homemade goodies, pictures, water bottles, magazines, dolphin-themed items, swim caps, candy, and notes of encouragement
          <li>Candies that <strong>MELT</strong> are a bad idea
          <li>Be sure to leave clues about who you are!

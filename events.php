                     <p class="lead">Pep rallies are a favorite activity each summer for all the swimmers.  Each Thursday before a home A meet the team will be making posters and decorating the pool for the meet!  Pep rallyâ€™s are for all Upper County Dolphin team members regardless of whether or not you are swimming in the meets. 
                      Come and be a part of the team spirit!!

                      Another team tradition is to travel together in a "caravan of cars" to away morning meets.  We will meet at Upper County pool where we can decorate the cars and the children!

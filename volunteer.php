              Parent volunteers are critical to the success of the swim season. It takes between 45 to 60 parents to run a swim meet! Many jobs require little to no experience such as timing and selling food at concessions. Other jobs such as referee, starter, and stroke/turn judge require certification. Although most jobs are suited for adults, some jobs can be performed by middle or high school swimmers who want to earn SSL/Volunteer hours. See below for more information.

              <strong>Heads up!</strong> The volunteer requirement per family is 5 obligations. Failure to fulfill this mandatory obligation will result a forfeiture of your child's priviledge to participate in meets.

              Middle and high school swimmers can earn student service learning (SSL) hours by volunteering at meets. <strong>These jobs do not count toward your 5 family obligations.</strong> Jobs that qualify for SSL hours are labeled “SSL Only” in signupgenius.
